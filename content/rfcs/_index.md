RFCs (Request for Comments) provide technical specifications and organisational
notes for `n3tuk`. They can provide information on networking, configurations,
service implementations, and architectural designs.

These are not directly standards, but a format for open discussion and to reach
a consensus at a specific point in time, and may be changed in the future, or
superseded by another RFC, should it be required.
