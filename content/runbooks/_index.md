Runbooks are a set of standardized written procedures for completing tasks which
must be undertaken manually. This may be because they're not suitable for
automating (for example, rotating the root certificate), or for helping to deal
with one-off events, such as incidents or downtime. Ultimately these runbooks
provide the standard operating procedures in selected situations.
