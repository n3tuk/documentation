## `n3tuk` Organisation

The `n3tuk` Organisation is a central organisation within GitHub for the
management and development of the infrastructure for `n3t.uk`, which includes:

- Privately-hosted Kubernetes Cluster on Intel NUCs;
- CloudFlare DNS and Zero-Trust networking;
- AWS Accounts and Services; and
- Testing and development applications and service.

## Components

There are a number of components used to build and develop this infrastructure:

- [`ansible`][github-ansible]: An [`ansible`][ansible] repository for the
  [bootstrap][bootstrap] installation, [baseline][baseline] setup, and
  [management][all] of physical and virtual servers and their services, such as
  [`vault`][vault], [`consul`][consul], [`etcd`][etcd], and of
  [`kubernetes`][kubernetes] itself.
- `terraform`: Multiple repositories based upon templates for Terraform
  [modules][modules] and [configurations][configurations], and kept up-to-date
  with the upstream repositories through a custom GitHub Action
  ([`action-synchronize-upstream`][action-synchronise]).
